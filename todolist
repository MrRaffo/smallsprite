This is a checklist of planned features with notes on how to implement them

Add the 'Sprite Grid', including selection and drawing of sprites

    Draw the grid outline, and highlight the currently selected sprite definition

    Create 'Add Sprite' button to add new sprites, similar to C64 SpritePad

    Each available sprite slot on the grid should be highlighted in some way, either
    by tinting the background or changing the colour of the slots border

    Each sprite that is currently defined, found by SPR_Number_Of_Sprites() should be drawn
    each frame, using the palette that it was created with

    Implement support for the scroller
